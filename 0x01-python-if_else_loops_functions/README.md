# Requirements
Python Scripts
 Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
 All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
 All your files should end with a new line
 The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
 A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
 Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
 ***All your files must be executable
 The length of your files will be tested using wc
 C Scripts
 Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
 All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
 All your files should end with a new line
 Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
 You are not allowed to use global variables
 No more than 5 functions per file
 In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
 The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
 Don’t forget to push your header file
 All your header files should be include guarded
 More Info
 Note: you do not need to understand lists yet.
