Copyright - Plagiarism

    You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
    You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.

Requirements
Python Scripts

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
    All your files should end with a new line
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
    All your files must be executable
    The length of your files will be tested using wc

C

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
    All your files should end with a new line
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    You are not allowed to use global variables
    No more than 5 functions per file
    In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
    The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
    Don’t forget to push your header file
    All your header files should be include guarded
